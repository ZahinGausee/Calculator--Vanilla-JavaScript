# Calculator Project

ðŸš€ Hey there! I'm excited to share my recent project, a simple yet functional **Calculator**, built using Vanilla JavaScript. ðŸ§®

## Motivation
This project was created as part of my learning journey with JavaScript, specifically to solidify my understanding of classes and constructors. Having recently delved into the world of web development through The Odin Project, I decided to put my newly acquired knowledge to the test and build a calculator from scratch.

## Features
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures a seamless experience on various devices.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript:** Leveraging classes and constructors to implement the calculator's functionality.
- **HTML/CSS:** Providing the structure and styling for the calculator.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Start crunching numbers with the calculator!

## Why a Calculator?
Building a calculator allowed me to apply the concepts I've learned in a practical context. It's a stepping stone towards more complex projects, and it significantly boosted my confidence in using JavaScript for real-world applications.

## Acknowledgments
- **The Odin Project:** A fantastic resource for web development, guiding me through the process of mastering JavaScript.
- **OpenAI GPT-3:** Assisting me with suggestions and guidance as I documented my project.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or even suggest enhancements. I'm eager to continue learning and improving my skills. Happy coding! ðŸš€
